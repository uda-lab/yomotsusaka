"""
Local boundary facade — ordinary-agent entry point over :mod:`yomotsusaka.boundary`.

This module provides :class:`LocalFacade`, a thin operational wrapper around
the five MVP-2 boundary entry points. It exists to spare in-process callers
from threading ``vault_root`` and a :class:`SearchGateway` through every call
site; it does not introduce a new public surface, a new type vocabulary, or
new policy.

Privacy invariant
-----------------
The facade adds **no code path** that returns a value the underlying
``boundary.*_request`` function would not have returned. Concretely:

* No path constructs the private-boundary resolver scope. The facade is
  hard-wired to ordinary-agent semantics, which is also the default scope
  inside :func:`boundary.inspect_request`. Callers needing private-boundary
  semantics (e.g. the future #27 restoration flow) must call
  :func:`boundary.resolve` directly with the appropriate scope value.
* No path imports or invokes the private restoration kernel module. The
  facade calls :func:`boundary.restoration_request` with
  ``scope=ResolverScope.ORDINARY_AGENT`` only; the boundary's scope gate
  guarantees that ordinary-agent restoration requests are denied with
  ``failure_reason="scope_denied"`` **before** the kernel module is
  imported or invoked. Callers needing private-boundary semantics must
  invoke :func:`boundary.restoration_request` directly with the
  appropriate scope.
* No path reads from ``<vault_root>/private/`` or exposes the internal
  ``vault_path`` field. The boundary already discards ``vault_path`` before
  returning a :class:`PublicHandle`; the facade is a pure delegator over
  that already-public surface.

These invariants are intentionally checkable by literal substring scan of
this file (see ``tests/test_facade.py``). Names that would violate the
invariant — including the private-scope enum member and the kernel
restoration module name — must not appear anywhere in this source file,
including in this docstring.

Out of scope
------------
* ``audit_log`` — the original issue body listed it as a candidate command,
  but no matching entry point exists in :mod:`boundary` for MVP-2 and the
  real audit-log surface is owned by #27. Adding it here would create a
  facade method without a backing boundary primitive.
* Any CLI wrapper — explicitly listed as a non-goal on #30. A future
  ``argparse`` wrapper can be layered on top of :class:`LocalFacade` without
  changing this module.
