"""
Execution gateway — Chikaeshi private execution boundary (deferred).

This module reserves the interface for the private execution gateway defined
in :doc:`architecture <../docs/architecture>` §13 and specified in
:doc:`chikaeshi <../docs/chikaeshi>`. Real dispatch is owned by the sibling
issue #43; this file is interface-only.

What this module declares (per the #42 reconciliation):

* :class:`ExecutionScope` — new ``str`` enum with values
  ``PRIVATE_BOUNDARY`` and ``ORDINARY_AGENT``. Does NOT reuse
  :class:`yomotsusaka.boundary.ResolverScope`; execution scope and locator
  resolution scope evolve independently and must not be coupled.
* :class:`ExecutionRequest` — frozen Pydantic v2 model carrying the
  template-job name, purpose tag, caller scope, and opaque inputs.
* :class:`ExecutionResponse` — frozen Pydantic v2 model carrying only
  opaque public handles, scrubbed text fragments, and the audit record id.
  Never carries raw private values, vault paths, or non-opaque identifiers.
* :class:`ExecutionFailure` — exception subclass of :class:`Exception`
  raised on policy/dispatch errors. Reserved for #43's dispatcher; this
  module does not raise it.

What this module deliberately does NOT do:

* :meth:`ExecutionGateway.execute` still returns the legacy
  ``{"status": "stub", "handle_id": ..., "operation": ...}`` dict. The new
  request/response models are *declared* and exported via ``__all__``, but
  are NOT plumbed into ``execute()``. Plumbing is owned by #43.
* No new agent-facing entry point is added to
  :mod:`yomotsusaka.boundary` or :mod:`yomotsusaka.facade`. The Chikaeshi
  request surface (``boundary.execute_request``, ``LocalFacade.execute``,
  etc.) lands in #43 (or later).
* Real policy enforcement, real template-job dispatch, real container
  execution, and real audit-record emission remain stubs. The classification
  in :doc:`scaffold-status <../docs/scaffold-status>` stays ``deferred``.

See ``docs/scaffold-status.md`` for module status and
``docs/backend-promotion.md`` §4 for the promotion gate.
